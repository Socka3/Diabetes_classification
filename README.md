# Diabetes classification using Scikit-learn

The objective of the project is to predict if patient has diabetes, based on predictor variables such as age, blood pressure, and bmi.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Data contains 768 complete records from the original dataset.



## Roadmap

- Exploratory data analysis

- K-nearest neighbors 
- Logistic Regression
- Support vector machine
- Logistic Regression - Model tuning
